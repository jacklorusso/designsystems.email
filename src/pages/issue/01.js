          I‚Äôll be keeping an ear to the ground on what is happening in the
          colliding worlds of design systems, styleguides and front-end
          architecture and sharing a few links per week that I believe are worth
          your time. The surface area of these topics blurs the lines between
          design and engineering, and the content of this newsletter will
          reflect this.

          Integrating Animation into a Design System [Article]
        </h3>
        <p>
          Motion is often introduced to a project in an ad hoc fashion. This
          article provides a solid foundation for the process of transitioning
          your menagerie of animations into a cohesive system. It‚Äôs packed with
          practical tips and examples from some of the most robust design
          systems in the wild.

          Introducing Design Systems Into Chaos [Talk]
        </h3>
        <p>
          Diana Mounter leads GitHub‚Äôs design systems team, who are responsible
          for building and maintaining the Primer CSS framework. She gives a
          detailed and insightful run-down of how GitHub began introducing some
          order back into their system after accumulating almost 10 years of
          diverging styles and approaches.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the key takeaways from her experience is that it‚Äôs never too
          early to get started on this process ‚Äî I‚Äôm sure many designers and
          engineers working on less mature products will have gleamed some
          encouragement from this.

          Thinking in Symbols for Universal Design [Talk]
        </h3>
        <p>
          Ben Wilkinson is Design Systems Lead at Airbnb. In this talk he takes
          us through the approach taken by Airbnb‚Äôs Design Language System
          (DLS); a flat component structure where each component is specific and
          named accordingly. The worked examples are especially valuable to
          those working with React or other component-based frameworks.

          Design Tools are Running Out of Track [Article]

        <p>
          Colm Tuite dissects a number of problems with the current state of
          mainstream design tooling - primarily, the fact that our tools export
          to images, instead of resembling the fluid and interactive context of
          our products. Jon Gold‚Äôs piece{' '}

          Writing Scalable React Apps with the Component Folder Pattern
          [Tutorial]
        </h3>
        <p>
          Breaking down complex pieces of a UI into bite sized and logical units
          of work is always a challenge. The component folder pattern is a handy
          approach to have up your sleeve to help organise your directory
          structure and make your components easier to understand and maintain.
